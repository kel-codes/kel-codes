- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m kellyn! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to use html & css to create designs that I have created on figma!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m slowly learning to bridge the gap between the knowledge that I have as a designer & knowledge of a developer.
- ðŸ“« I'm a newbie coder, but I'm always open to feedback on how I can improve, feel free to reach out. :>
